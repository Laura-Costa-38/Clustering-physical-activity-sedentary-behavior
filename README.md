As part of my second-year Master’s program, I completed a data project using a Kaggle dataset to perform clustering based on individuals’ physical activity and sedentary behavior. I applied the KMeans algorithm and built transition matrices to evaluate the stability of each cluster. A large part of the project involved handling missing data, managing outliers, and ensuring reliable, clean datasets. Additionally, I explored differences in other variables, such as sleep quality, across clusters. The entire analysis was carried out in Python 3.12 using Jupyter Notebook, giving me hands-on experience in data cleaning, clustering, exploration, and reproducible workflows.
